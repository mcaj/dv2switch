This is my hackweek project from SUSE Hackweek 9.


Base on the video setup from : Recording presentation I`d like to create a small script all to use two video source on the one machine. Then We don't need "Mixer Laptop (with Fire-wire & Gbit)" and can connect all in one machine.

The script should be user friendly and allow to start recording without deep knowledge of fire-ware and dvswitch.
